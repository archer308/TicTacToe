The Strategy

1)  Take a win
2)  Take an opponent's win
3)  Take a 2win spot
4)  Take an opponent's 2win spot; If there are multiple 2win spots, then take an even number over an odd.

	Take a 1win spot?  For this situation:
		X1O
		OXX
		49O

	Where 1 and 9 can be seen as better than 4.
	However, an opponent would have to let us win in this situation.
	Our computer AI as describe here would not let X win.
	So let's not implement this.  It is fine if our AI takes 4 in this situation.

5)  If opponent has 0 pieces, take 8.
6)  If opponent has at least 1 piece, take 5.
		i)   If 5 is taken, take 8.
		ii)  If 8 is taken, take 2.
		iii) If 2 is taken, take a random spot.




The "2win spot" idea might have ended up being a nice strategy, but I didn't actually go this way.
